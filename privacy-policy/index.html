   <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 7th, 2024</p>

   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>Welcome to Monkey mall, an Oculus Quest VR fan game developed by TMTime. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information while you enjoy my game. By using Monkey mall, you consent to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

   <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
   <p>We may collect the following types of information when you use Monkey mall:</p>
   <ol>
       <li><strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> We may collect information you provide when you interact with the game, such as your Oculus username and your Oculus user ID to identify you and your Payment information when you do in app purchases. We also access your Meta friends for players to friend each other in game.</li>
       <li><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> We collect certain information automatically as you use Monkey mall, including your device type, your internet protocol address (IP address), the state and city you live in (WE WILL NOT SELL THE INFORMATION TO ANY ONE), your Meta quest account username and gameplay analytics (FPS etc.) and every room/lobby you join in Monkey mall.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
   <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
   <ol>
       <li><strong>Providing and Enhancing the Game:</strong> We use your gameplay analytics to operate, maintain, and improve Monkey mall, including developing new features, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance.</li>
       <li><strong>Analytics and Research:</strong> We analyze user data to understand how players interact with the game and improve the overall gaming experience.</li>
       <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Monkey mall uses voice chat which means your microphone gets recorded and send to the voice chat servers (aka Photon Voice servers) (WE DO NOT STORE ANY OF THOSE RECORDINGS). I use your Meta quest account username to identify you and other players.</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>Data Security and Limitations</h2>
   <p>While we take reasonable measures to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the absolute safety of your data due to the presence of potential hackers seeking data leaks. However, in the event of a security breach or any other incident that may compromise your data, Monkey mall will immediately go into lock down mode to minimize further risks. I will conduct a thorough investigation to identify the cause of the incident and take appropriate actions to prevent similar occurrences in the future.</p>

   <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
   <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your user data that we have collected or stored. If you wish to delete your data, please contact support at our <a href="https://discord.gg/monkey-mall-1089943072915345479">Discord</a> with your deletion request. You will have to send your PlayFab ID to me on Discord (to ensure it's you who sends the ID for deletion we might ask in what city and state you live in). We will make reasonable efforts to fulfill your request, subject to any legal obligations. Please note that deleting your data WILL result in the loss of in-game currency, items, and progress, as your information is saved in your PlayFab account.</p>
