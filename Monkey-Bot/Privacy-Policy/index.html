    <h1>Privacy Policy for Monkey bot</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Monkey bot (the "Bot") handles user information and outlines what data is collected, how it is used, and the responsibilities of users regarding their privacy when interacting with the Bot on Discord. By using Monkey bot, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Information Collected by Monkey bot</h2>

    <h3>User ID Verification</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When users trigger certain commands, the Bot may check the User ID of the user executing the command. This is done to verify permissions, ensure command functionality, and provide personalized responses.</li>
        <li>No Storage: The Bot does not store User IDs or any other personal information on its servers. The User ID is only checked in real-time during command execution and is not retained afterward.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>DSharpPlus Data Handling</h3>
    <p>Monkey bot is built using the DSharpPlus library. DSharpPlus may handle the following data temporarily to facilitate communication between Discord's servers and the Bot:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Message content:</strong> When a command is triggered, the content of the message may be processed to understand and execute the command.</li>
        <li><strong>Guild information:</strong> Information about the server (guild) where the command was triggered may be processed to ensure proper functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>User details:</strong> Basic user details, such as username and avatar, may be accessed to provide a personalized experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Temporary Storage:</strong> When the users trigger any command, the Bot displays in what guild/server and who triggered the command until the Bot gets restarted, updated, crashed or shutdown. Any data handled by DSharpPlus is only stored temporarily in memory and is not retained by the Bot or its servers once the command execution is complete.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Persistent Storage:</strong> The Bot stores personal data only when blocking access to a user due to breaking the rules by blocking their user id. The bot does not store messages, or any other information, on its servers. Almost all processing is done in real-time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Bot may use Discord's APIs and services to function. Users are advised to review Discord's Privacy Policy to understand how Discord collects, uses, and stores user data. The Discord Privacy Policy can be found at <a href="https://discord.com/privacy">Discord Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>By using Monkey bot, users acknowledge that they have reviewed and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to the collection and use of information as described.</li>
        <li>Users should regularly review the privacy policies of any third-party services, such as Discord, that they interact with when using the Bot.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>The Bot reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. Users will be notified of any significant changes, and continued use of the Bot after such changes will constitute acceptance of the new policy.</p>

    <div class="contact">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>For any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the owner of Monkey bot (tmtimevr).</p>
